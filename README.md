How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I think the best way to do this is to start off with a static test of all the documents that you have before you start your project. I wanted to make sure that all my diagrams are correct, my requirements are correct, etc. I also want to make sure that I've included everything that I needed in my outline of the project. After the code is written, is important to check for any errors and then test it. J-unit tests are a great way to do this to make sure that the program is doing what it is supposed to do. I've also gone through and tested my program my self by acting like a user of the program and using it like I intend it to be used. testing is one of the most important parts of the entire process to make sure that the software is up to par before it is submitted.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The way that I interpret user needs is by looking user stories if their avaiable, and if those are not avaiable, I look at the requirements and imagine being a user of the program. This helps me imagine what I would want to see in the program if I was a user. The user stories themselves really help get a glimpse into what a user of the program would want. These can be very good guides onto what to developer while writing software. 

How do I approach designing software?

I like to be organized before I design any software. The way to do this is doing an outline of the software that I will be producing. This includes what I want to add such as classes, etc. It also includes anything that I think will help. After that, I design it in what I think makes logical sense. For example, in this class, I made my contact class before I made my contact test.
